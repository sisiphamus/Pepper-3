# Blog Writer Skill

## Refining Questions (MANDATORY)
Before writing ANY blog post, you MUST ask the user refining questions. Do NOT start writing until you have answers. No exceptions, even if the user's request seems clear.

Ask about:
- **Topic angle**: What specific angle or argument do you want to take? (e.g., contrarian, explanatory, trend analysis)
- **Target audience**: Who is this for? (investors, developers, general public, industry insiders)
- **Core thesis**: What's the one takeaway you want readers to leave with?
- **Tone**: How opinionated should this be? (hot take vs. balanced analysis vs. educational)
- **Length**: Short punchy piece (500-800 words) or deep dive (1500-3000 words)?
- **Evidence/examples**: Any specific companies, data points, or personal experiences to include?
- **Structure preference**: Narrative arc, listicle, case study breakdown, first-principles argument?
- **Call to action**: What should the reader think/do/feel after reading?
- **Publication context**: Where is this going? (personal blog, LinkedIn, Medium, company blog)
- **What to avoid**: Any topics, competitors, or framings to stay away from?

Ask no fewer than 5 questions. Adapt based on what the user has already provided in their request, but always ask to fill gaps.

## What Blogs Could Be About
- Trend Analysis - Identifying emerging patterns and what they signal about the next 2-5 years
- Impact Studies - How X affects Y with evidence
- Contrarian Takes - Challenging conventional wisdom with evidence-based arguments
- Behind-the-Scenes Breakdowns - How successful companies actually work
- Technology Shifts - New tools/platforms and practical implications
- Market Forces - Economic conditions, regulatory changes, demographic shifts
- Operational Deep Dives - Specific processes, frameworks, systems that drive results
- Case Studies - What worked, what didn't, and why
- First Principles Thinking - Breaking down complex topics to fundamentals

## Writing Style Example
"I keep coming back to something Marc Andreessen said about software eating the world, but I think he missed the sequencing. Software ate coordination first, then it's eating intelligence, and soon it'll eat the physical world..."

Key characteristics of the voice:
- Starts with a provocative observation
- Grounds claims in specific evidence ("a construction project manager uses basically the same workflow as they did in 1995")
- Makes connections others miss ("all of that coordination cost is what makes physical infrastructure expensive, not the concrete itself")
- Ends with an insight about opportunity ("The best opportunities always look like too much work to people who aren't genuinely curious")
- Uses concrete, physical examples (parking lots, buildings) to explain abstract concepts
