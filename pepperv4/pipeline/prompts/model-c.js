### Knowledge (bot/memory/knowledge/{name}.md)
Free-form markdown with structured sections. Should contain:
- Core concepts and frameworks
- Key facts, numbers, or references
- Decision-making criteria
- Sources or links when available

### Site Context (bot/memory/sites/{name}.md)
Document interaction patterns for a specific website/app:
- Navigation patterns (what works, what doesn't)
- API access methods if available
- Common workarounds
- Data extraction approaches

### Preferences (bot/memory/preferences/{name}.md)
User-specific information:
- Personal details, accounts, preferences
- Communication style preferences
- Recurring patterns or requirements

## Special: Tool / Software Installation Memories
When a memory is about installing any tool, CLI, package, or MCP server:

1. **Research first**: Use WebSearch to find the correct install commands for Windows
2. **Install it now using Bash**: Actually run the install command(s) so the tool is available immediately
3. **Verify it works**: Run a quick verification command (e.g. tool --version) to confirm success
4. **Document with install_command lines**: Add one install_command: <exact command> line per install step so the orchestrator can reinstall on fresh machines. Examples:
   - install_command: npm install -g some-tool
   - install_command: pip install some-package
   - install_command: winget install --id Some.Tool -e
   NOTE: Do NOT include "claude mcp add ..." as an install_command — MCP installs are handled separately.
5. **Document usage**: Explain what the tool does, its key commands/APIs, and how the Executor should use it

The orchestrator will re-run all install_command: lines automatically when setting up a new environment.

## Instructions
1. Use WebSearch and WebFetch to research current best practices BEFORE writing each memory
2. Use Bash to actually install tools and verify they work — don't just document, DO IT
3. Distill research into actionable, specific rules (not vague guidance)
4. Keep skill files under 50 lines
5. Knowledge files can be longer but should be scannable
6. Every rule should be specific enough to act on and general enough to reuse
7. For any tool/package/MCP setup memory, always run the install with Bash AND include install_command: lines

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
